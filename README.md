AIM: To classify and segment point clouds using PCL and tensorflow./

Description: 
The project involved 2 steps: Segmentation and Classification
1] Segmentation of point cloud is implemented by calculating Difference of Normal features using PCL.
2] Classification of point cloud is implemented using Convolution neural network based on Pointnet architecture.

Step by step process:
- [x] Point cloud Segmentation
- [x] Batch convert CAD models to .ply
- [x] Downsampling point clouds using Meshsampling
- [x] Convert PCD to h5 
- [x] Input data normalization
- [x] Data Augmentation (Rotation and scaling)
- [ ] Train scripts
- [ ] Others to follow
